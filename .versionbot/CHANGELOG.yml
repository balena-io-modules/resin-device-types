      hash: a250f4890517855c17c780424db24773243cfb2a
      body: |
        This repository is in maintenance mode with the intention of deprecating
        the use of `device-type.json`.

        As no tests are specified in this repository just add a success
        placeholder for flowzone to allow merges.
